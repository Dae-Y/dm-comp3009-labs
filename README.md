## Setup and Usage

To run the code, you will need **Python** and the necessary libraries installed.  
It is recommended to use a **virtual environment**.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dm-comp3009-labs.git
cd dm-comp3009-labs
```

### 2. Install the required packages
*(You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file first by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the libraries.)*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the labs
Navigate to a specific lab's directory and run the Python script. For example:
```bash
cd lab01
python lab_solution.py
```
