Key difference between att3 and att4 in this dataset:

att3
Attribute name: age
Data type: numeric (integer/float)
Meaning: The patient’s age in years.
Range: roughly from teenage years up to 80+.
Continuous variable, so when you discretize into bins, you’ll see intervals like [15–22), [22–29), etc.

att4
Attribute name: sex
Data type: categorical (nominal, binary coded as 1 or 2)
Meaning: Patient’s biological sex.
1 = male
2 = female

Since it’s categorical with only two values, 
it doesn’t make sense to apply equi-depth or equi-width binning the same way as with a continuous attribute like age.
So the difference is:

att3 is continuous numeric (age) – good candidate for normalization and discretization.
att4 is categorical/binary (sex) – should generally be treated as a label/feature with two categories, 
                                   not binned into numeric ranges.
