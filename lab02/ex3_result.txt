Reflection on Sample Mean Convergence

Trend as sample size increases:
As n increases, the average z-score (ẑₙ) decreases steadily.
Small samples (n=10, 20) have large deviations, while larger samples
approach the population mean more closely, with z-scores trending toward zero.

Why z-score is useful:
The z-score normalizes deviation in terms of standard deviations,
making it independent of the raw scale of the 'count' attribute.
This allows meaningful comparison of deviations across sample sizes.
